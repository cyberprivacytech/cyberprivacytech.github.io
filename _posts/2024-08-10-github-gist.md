Check out my [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/alexeinazarov/84731ed2f1479dc6e75e002e65030b0d) for an in-depth exploration of the methods used by cybercriminals to bypass 3D Secure and compromise bank card transactions. The Gist includes:

- **Phishing & Social Engineering**: How attackers exploit human vulnerabilities to bypass security protocols.
- **Replay Attacks**: Techniques for capturing and reusing authentication tokens.
- **Legitimate Services Misuse**: Leveraging legitimate services to sidestep 3D Secure checks.
- **Compromised Merchant/Acquirer Systems**: Real-world examples of breaches in merchant systems.
- **Implementation Flaws in 3D Secure**: Exploiting weaknesses in earlier versions of 3D Secure.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Attacks involving intercepted communications.
- **Internal Breach & Key Leakage**: Risks associated with internal security breaches.
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Sophisticated, targeted cyber attacks on financial institutions.

The Gist is backed by references to standards and guidelines from NIST, OWASP, and ISO/IEC, providing a comprehensive resource for cybersecurity professionals.
